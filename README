A graphical Map Editor for the Boulder-Dash clone, Epiphany!

See INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.

Have fun!

epiphany-editor is developed using the git revision control system.

You should see a .git directory which contains the full revision control
history for the project.

Just get git on your system and get hacking!
